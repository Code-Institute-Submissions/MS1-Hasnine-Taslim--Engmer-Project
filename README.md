# MS1-Hasnine-Taslim-Engmer Project
 Project Idea:
 A Website using HTML, CSS, JS to promote English language courses for Swedish speaking kids

External User's goal:
The site's potentials users are mainly parents of local Swedish speaking kids and kids themselves. They will find
information on English language courses that site owner offers. User can also find information about importance of learning English
from early ages. If they decide to take the courses they will find more information by contacting site owner.


Site Owner's goal:
The site owner wishes to attract more students to the offered courses. Normally 8-16 years old children do not make the final decision 
of taking an foreign language learning course outside of their school curriculum. So site owner's target is to be noticed by the parents
first, update their knowledge about learning English facts. And finally convince them to buy the at least one monthly subscription language courses.  Also the site owner would like to answer any question the kids might have about the course thought a contact form.

Font Use:

I really love the font Helvetica because its contemporary look and easy readability.
When spaced out it looks beautiful and relaxed.

UX design & Responsive Design:

Basic and simple interaction with the user. User can easily see the navigation panel and click and navigate. Features like 
only 4 different pages, limited articles, minimum choice offering, no diversion, always visible navigation panel would create 'easy to access' and 'easy to understanding' and finally 'easy to choose' experiences for the user. Once they are ready to order or ready to get more information user will use 'Request a Call' form to contact the site owner.
